    I'm a sophomore at the <a href="http://www.upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania</a> in Philadelphia studying Mechanical Engineering, with minors in Computer Science, Mathematics, and French. I work as a research assistant in group in the <a href="https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/research-groups/kumar-lab">GRASP Lab</a> at Penn, developing autonomous aerial vehicles to intercept projectiles mid-flight. I'm passionate about innovation, conservation, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pennanimaladvocacy">animal ethics</a>, and making beautiful things.
